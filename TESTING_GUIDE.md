# Order Detail Fixes - Testing Guide

## What Was Fixed
1. **Cart Items Display**: Updated CartItem model to use BigDecimal for proper JSON deserialization
2. **Total Amount Calculation**: Implemented multi-priority total calculation with extensive logging
3. **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive null safety and fallback mechanisms

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Install and Launch App
```bash
# If you have ADB installed, install the APK:
adb install app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk

# OR manually install the APK on your device/emulator
```

### Step 2: Navigate to Order Detail
1. Launch the ShopMate app
2. Login with your credentials
3. Navigate to Profile → Order History
4. Tap on any order to view Order Detail
5. **Recommended**: Test with Order ID 78 (the one we verified with API)

### Step 3: Verify Cart Items Display
**Expected Results:**
- Cart items should now display properly (not "Cart Items is null")
- Each item should show:
  - Product name
  - Quantity 
  - Price (formatted in VND)
  - Subtotal (formatted in VND)

### Step 4: Verify Total Amount
**Expected Results:**
- Total amount should display correctly (not "Total Amount: 0đ")
- Amount should be properly formatted in Vietnamese currency
- Check logcat for detailed calculation logs

### Step 5: Check Logs (Important for Debugging)
Run this command to see detailed logs:
```bash
adb logcat | findstr "OrderDetailFragment"
```

**Key Log Messages to Look For:**
- `"API Response received: ..."` - Confirms API call success
- `"Setting cart items with ... items"` - Confirms cart items parsing
- `"Total amount calculation: ..."` - Shows which calculation method was used
- `"Order detail loaded successfully"` - Confirms overall success

## Expected Log Output
```
OrderDetailFragment: API Response received: OrderDetailResponse{cartItems=[...], totalAmount=X, payments=[...]}
OrderDetailFragment: Setting cart items with X items
OrderDetailFragment: Total amount calculation: Using totalAmount from response: X VND
OrderDetailFragment: Order detail loaded successfully
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Cart Items Still Show as Null:
1. Check logcat for JSON parsing errors
2. Verify API is returning cartItems array
3. Look for BigDecimal conversion issues in logs

### If Total Amount Still Shows 0:
1. Check which calculation priority was used in logs
2. Verify payments array exists in API response
3. Check if cart items have valid price/quantity values

### If Issues Persist:
1. Clear app data and retry
2. Check network connectivity
3. Verify backend API is returning expected JSON structure
4. Review logcat for detailed error messages

## Backend API Verification
You can verify the API is working correctly:
```bash
curl -X GET "YOUR_API_BASE_URL/v1/orders/detail/78" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

Expected response should include:
- `cartItems` array with items
- `totalAmount` as BigDecimal
- `payments` array with amount values

## Files Modified
- `CartItem.java` - Updated to use BigDecimal
- `OrderDetailFragment.java` - Enhanced with logging and multi-priority calculation
- Backend `OrderService.java` - Already working correctly

## Build Information
- APK Location: `app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk`
- Build Status: ✅ SUCCESS (32 tasks completed)
- Compilation: No errors, ready for testing
